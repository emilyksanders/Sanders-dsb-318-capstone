    "Meyer's original study was longitudinal, so the dataset he provided included responses from the participants at up to three different times of measurement, referred to as waves.  Many authors have done excellent analyses on this time-series element.  However, as is often the case, Meyer's study suffered from attrition effects, and only 616 participants responded to all three rounds of data collection.  In the interest of preserving a larger sample, I chose to cross-sectionally investigate the wave 1 responses only, for an initial sample size of 1518.  Therefore, I dropped the columns pertaining to wave 2 or 3."

Out of this necessity, I opted to allow a larger proportion of imputed data than I would b inclined to do if I had rows to spare.

Where possible, they filled missing values with logical inferences based on that participant's other responses.  Where that was not possible, they predicted the missing value based on a regression of the participant's other responses, then imputed a randomly selected value from the 5 extant values nearest to that prediction.  See page 30 of *37166-Documentation-methodology.pdf* for more details."

NaN, 97 (float or int), and sometimes 7, all referred to missing data; NaNs appeared where participants declined to answer a question that was asked of them, and 7 or 97 appeared when participants were not asked the question at all, usually due to their response to a previous question (e.g., answering \"no\" to \"Do you currently have health insurance?\", and then not being asked \"What kind of health insurance do you have?\").  For all such columns, I converted the NaNs and 97s to 0s, and the target values to 1s.  The 7s required more careful attention, because they were legitimate values in some columns and essentially NAs in others."
